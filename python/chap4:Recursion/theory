********************************** Recursion ***********************************

Recursion is a technique by which a function calls itself once or more during
execution, or technique by which a data structure relies on smaller instances of
very same data type in it's representation.
Examples in art and nature: Fractal patterns, Russian Matryoshka dolls.

Factorial Function (n!)
English Ruler (example of fractal structure)
Binary search
File System

Recursion necessarily contains one or more base cases ans recursive cases.

In python every time a function is called, recursive or otherwise, a structure
called activation record or frame is created to store the progress. This
activation record contains namespace for storing function call's parameters and
local variables and information about which command is currently being executed
in the function.
For each call, there is a different activation record. Whenever a function calls
another function or itself, the activation record the point in the source code
from where the function resumes execution.

** Namespaces :
    The process of determining the value associated with an identifier is called
    name resolution. NameError is thrown is no associated objects serving as
    values is found.
    Whenever assignment is made to an identifier, the definition is made within
    a scope. It can be global as well as local.
    Each distinct scope is represented using an abstraction known as namespace.
    A namespace manages all the identifiers defined in a given scope.
** Fractal :
    A shape that has self-recursive structure at various levels of
    magnification.
